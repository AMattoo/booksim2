 I tried to combine the allocator files, though the files are identical between nocsim and booksim, but I have no idea how it actually works =(

 I don't really understand the arbiter code either, added a update function to priority arbiter. There was minor differences between the two (an if) statement, but functionally should be identical

 Configuration files such as lex, yacc and stuff has been moved, strangely config.tab.* are not required before compilate was sucessful. Also config_tab.* seem to be doing the same job that config.tab.* does, did someone compiled them using _ in stead of .

 Ah configuration file resolved. Make file has line cp -f $*.tab.c $*_tab.cpp therefore these files shoudl be identical. And they are 

-rwxrwx--x  1 qtedq qtedq 30915 Jun 27  2007 config.tab.c
-rwxrwx--x  1 qtedq qtedq 30915 Jun 27  2007 config_tab.cpp
-rwxrwx--x  1 qtedq qtedq  1816 Jun 27  2007 config.tab.h
-rwxrwx--x  1 qtedq qtedq  1816 Jun 27  2007 config_tab.hpp

 Nocsim uses flitchannel and credit channel classes to simulate channel latency, book sim does not and alway asume latency of 1. This will generate shit storm later

 Bufferstate start the introduction of flit types and specific virtual channels set aside for them. _vc_range_* stores their range. Also,somethin looks strange with the take buffer function, why would it set a vc to in use
